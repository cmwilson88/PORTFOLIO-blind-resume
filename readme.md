# Blind Effort

Blind Effort is a blind resume screening application that seeks to reduce bias in the resume screening process.  This was a group project built by three student developers at DevMountain.

## Features

* Users can build their resumes with multiple work experiences, education, and skills
* Companies can create job postings for positions open at their companies
* Users can view job postings, filter search results in four different ways, and submit job applications
* Companies can view submitted resumes without demographic information to reduce screening bias and select candidates based on the other qualities on their resume
* Companies can view demographic and contact information of the candidates that have gone through the selection process
